The purpose of this K23 proposal is to prepare the applicant for a career in developing and implementing interventions that begin in pregnancy to prevent child obesity using innovative and scalable delivery platforms, and to adapt and pilot test an evidence-based child obesity prevention intervention to be optimized for remote, virtual delivery. The knowledge gained from this proposal will help to address the critical need for scalable child obesity prevention programs that aim to eliminate disparities in child obesity and its adverse downstream consequences.
